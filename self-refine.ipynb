    "### Self-Refine: Iterative Feedback and Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`self_refine`** function is designed to generate and refine a solution for a mathematical problem using multiple rounds of self-critique and improvement. It carefully orchestrates how the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Produces an Initial Draft**  \n",
    "   - The function prompts the model to solve the math problem in a rigorous, step-by-step manner.\n",
    "   - This initial draft serves as the baseline that will be critiqued in the subsequent steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generates Feedback**  \n",
    "   - In each round, the model is presented with its own prior output (the “draft answer”) along with the original problem.\n",
    "   - It is asked to analyze correctness, clarity, and completeness, suggesting specific improvements if errors are found.  \n",
    "   - If the model indicates “no improvement needed,” and at least one round of refinement has already occurred, the process may stop early.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Refines the Answer**  \n",
    "   - Following the feedback, the model refines its previous draft to address the identified gaps or errors.\n",
    "   - This new refined answer replaces the old draft and can be further iterated upon if additional rounds are available or required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **At-Least-One-Round Condition**  \n",
    "   - The function ensures that the model goes through at least one refinement cycle. If the model declares “everything is correct” on the very first round, the function still carries out that round to solidify an improved version of the draft (if needed) before checking for early termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Early Stopping**  \n",
    "   - In subsequent rounds (after the first has completed), if the model’s feedback repeatedly indicates no more changes are necessary or the draft is already correct, the iteration halts. This “early stopping” heuristic reduces unnecessary computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Usage and Round Tracking**  \n",
    "   - Every call to the model (for either feedback or refinement) accumulates usage data—such as the total token count—into a running total.\n",
    "   - The function also records which round triggered the exit, whether due to reaching the maximum number of allowed rounds or stopping early after an “all good” declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Extracting the Final Answer**  \n",
    "   - Once the iterations conclude, the final, refined text is passed through a function (e.g., `extract_final_answer`) to parse out the numeric result or short answer if desired.\n",
    "   - This extracted value, along with the full refined text, the total token usage, and the index of the last refinement round, is returned to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points & Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rigorous System Prompt**  \n",
    "  - The model is cast in the role of a “rigorous math tutor,” ensuring detailed reasoning and clarity in every generation.\n",
    "  - >Since both temperature and top_p can control the diversity of generated text, it is recommended that you only set one of them. \n",
    "    - So I lowered the temperature a bit, reduced the diversity appropriately, and ensured the rigor of the mathematical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback-Refine Loop**  \n",
    "  The model alternates between critiquing its own output and improving it, thereby aiming to catch logical or computational mistakes in a structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mandatory Improvement Round**  \n",
    "  The function will not accept an immediate “no improvement” response for the first refinement attempt. This ensures that, at a minimum, the model has made one pass to reevaluate its initial draft.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early Stop Heuristic**  \n",
    "  After at least one refinement, if the model states that no further changes are needed, the loop terminates early. This method is a convenience to reduce overhead when the model is sufficiently confident.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Absolute Guarantee of Correctness**  \n",
    "  While the approach often enhances solution quality, the model’s own judgment may still fail to catch subtler errors. For high-stakes scenarios, external validation (e.g., test suites or domain experts) is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Return Structure**  \n",
    "  The final output includes:\n",
    "  1. **`final_text`**: The model’s last refined draft (full textual answer).  \n",
    "  2. **`final_answer`**: The numeric or short result extracted from `final_text`.  \n",
    "  3. **`ended_on_round`**: Which round triggered the exit, either because of reaching the maximum iteration or early stopping.  \n",
    "  4. **`total_usage`**: A cumulative usage metric (e.g., total tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure illustrates a practical way to nudge large language models toward more self-critical and iteratively improved answers, particularly for math-oriented tasks."
