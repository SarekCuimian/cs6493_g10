    "\n",
    "The **`call_model`** function is designed to invoke a large language model (LLM) through DashScope in a way that **preserves multi-round context**. Rather than passing a one-time prompt, it accepts a **list of messages**—each labeled with a role (`system`, `user`, or `assistant`)—that collectively represent the conversation history. This approach enables an iterative, dialogic style of interaction with the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conversation as a List of Messages**  \n",
    "   - We store every piece of text that shapes the conversation (system instructions, user questions, model replies) in a Python list called `messages`.  \n",
    "   - Each element is a structure with fields like `role` (e.g., `system`, `user`, `assistant`) and `content` (the actual text).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **System-Level Instructions**  \n",
    "   - At the start of the list, we often include a “system” message that defines the model’s role or behavior (“You are a rigorous math tutor…”).  \n",
    "   - Unlike a single-pass prompt, this system message persists throughout every exchange, ensuring the LLM remains consistent in style and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Queries and Model Responses**  \n",
    "   - For each round of interaction, we append a new `user` message with the user’s request or instructions.  \n",
    "   - The model’s reply then comes back as `assistant` text, which we likewise insert into the `messages` list.  \n",
    "   - Over time, this list accumulates the entire conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Self-Refine Alignment**  \n",
    "   - Because all prior messages (including the model’s own previous answers) are visible in the list, the LLM can read and critique its own past output.  \n",
    "   - This structure naturally supports the **feedback → refinement** cycle described in the Self-Refine paradigm, as the model sees both the problem statement and its earlier reasoning steps whenever it generates new content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **DashScope Invocation**  \n",
    "   - On each call, `call_model` sends the current `messages` list to the DashScope service, specifying the temperature and other parameters.  \n",
    "   - DashScope’s API returns the model’s fresh reply (an “assistant” role string) and usage statistics (like token counts).  \n",
    "   - We update the `messages` with the new assistant message, thus preserving context for the next round.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Context Preservation**  \n",
    "   - By passing **the entire conversation history** each time, we mimic the idea of a session that retains prior knowledge, enabling multi-step problem-solving or iterative refinement.  \n",
    "   - This stands in contrast to single-prompt APIs that only see their immediate input. Here, the model is re-supplied with both the user’s original questions and any subsequent instructions or feedback, capturing the logic of self-critique and incremental improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Benefits and Considerations**  \n",
    "   - **Enhanced Consistency**: The model maintains continuity across multiple rounds, remembering earlier details or constraints.  \n",
    "   - **Scalability**: Because the conversation grows each iteration, users should watch out for token limit constraints and trim older or less relevant messages if needed.  \n",
    "   - **Clearer Control Flow**: The code that orchestrates Self-Refine can systematically add new messages (feedback requests, draft solutions, refined outputs, etc.), making the dialogue flow explicit and easy to follow."

    "The `self_refine` function implements a multi-round refinement process for math problem solving, following the Self-Refine paradigm. It uses a single, persistent `messages` list to simulate a continuous dialogue with the model, allowing it to build upon its own previous answers and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Draft**\n",
    "   - The function begins by prompting the model to generate a step-by-step solution to the math problem.\n",
    "   - This initial response is saved as an assistant message in the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feedback and Refinement Loop**\n",
    "   - Each round, the model is asked to critique its last answer.\n",
    "   - It then receives its own feedback and is prompted to revise accordingly.\n",
    "   - All exchanges (questions, answers, feedback) are appended to the same `messages` list, preserving full context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Session-Based Memory**\n",
    "   - By keeping the entire conversation in a single session, the model sees the full reasoning history at every step.\n",
    "   - This allows coherent self-correction and aligns with the original Self-Refine paper’s methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Early Stopping (with Safeguard)**\n",
    "   - The model may exit early if it declares the answer already correct — but only after completing at least **one** refinement cycle.\n",
    "   - This ensures robustness without redundant computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Output**\n",
    "   - The last refined answer is parsed to extract the final numeric result.\n",
    "   - The function returns this result, the full answer text, number of rounds used, and total token usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Key Points & Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rigorous System Prompt**  \n",
    "  - The model is cast in the role of a “rigorous math tutor,” ensuring detailed reasoning and clarity in every generation.\n",
    "  - >Since both temperature and top_p can control the diversity of generated text, it is recommended that you only set one of them. \n",
    "    - So I lowered the temperature a bit, reduced the diversity appropriately, and ensured the rigor of the mathematical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback-Refine Loop**  \n",
    "  The model alternates between critiquing its own output and improving it, thereby aiming to catch logical or computational mistakes in a structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mandatory Improvement Round**  \n",
    "  The function will not accept an immediate “no improvement” response for the first refinement attempt. This ensures that, at a minimum, the model has made one pass to reevaluate its initial draft.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early Stop Heuristic**  \n",
    "  After at least one refinement, if the model states that no further changes are needed, the loop terminates early. This method is a convenience to reduce overhead when the model is sufficiently confident.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Absolute Guarantee of Correctness**  \n",
    "  While the approach often enhances solution quality, the model’s own judgment may still fail to catch subtler errors. For high-stakes scenarios, external validation (e.g., test suites or domain experts) is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Return Structure**  \n",
    "  The final output includes:\n",
    "  1. **`final_text`**: The model’s last refined draft (full textual answer).  \n",
    "  2. **`final_answer`**: The numeric or short result extracted from `final_text`.  \n",
    "  3. **`ended_on_round`**: Which round triggered the exit, either because of reaching the maximum iteration or early stopping.  \n",
    "  4. **`total_usage`**: A cumulative usage metric (e.g., total tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure illustrates a practical way to nudge large language models toward more self-critical and iteratively improved answers, particularly for math-oriented tasks."

    "### 4.3 Token Truncation Strategy\n",
    "\n",

    "### 7.1 Example Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1.1 Over-Refinement and Semantic Drift in Round 5\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable failure case occurred during a 5-round self-refinement process on the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. How many total points did he score?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct Answer:** 9  \n",
    "- **Initial Answer (Round 0):** ✅ Correct and well-reasoned  \n",
    "- **Final Answer (Round 5):** ❌ Incorrect: `\"25\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Root Causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early-Stop Missed:**  \n",
    "   The model correctly stated `\"No improvement needed\"` after Round 1, but refinement continued unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token Bloat:**  \n",
    "   By Round 5, the total token count reached **15,000+**, leading to model confusion and truncated context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Degenerated Responses:**  \n",
    "   Feedback and refinement rounds began producing repetitive or placeholder output such as `Final Answer: <number>` without logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extraction Fallback Misdirection:**  \n",
    "   Since no valid `Final Answer:` or `\\boxed{...}` appeared, the extractor defaulted to the last numeric value found — incorrectly selecting `\"25\"`. \n",
    "   Model last said **[ truncated solution provided by the user ]**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "- Over-refinement can **harm accuracy**.\n",
    "- Strict early-stop conditions and smarter fallback behavior are essential.\n",
    "- It may be beneficial to **cache earlier correct answers** in case later rounds degrade in quality.\n",

    "#### 7.1.2 Consistent Logical Error in Round 2\n",
    "\n",
    "While the self-refinement framework is designed to iteratively improve reasoning quality, it may still fail when the model makes a **consistent logical error** from the beginning. One representative example is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> Josh decides to try flipping a house. He buys a house for \\$80,000 and then puts in \\$50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "In every round, the model followed this reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Total cost** = \\$80,000 + \\$50,000 = \\$130,000  \n",
    "2. **Value increase** = 150% of \\$80,000 = \\$120,000  \n",
    "3. **Final value** = \\$80,000 + \\$50,000 + \\$120,000 = \\$250,000  \n",
    "4. **Profit** = \\$250,000 - \\$130,000 = **\\$120,000**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although each step appears logical and well-structured, it is based on a **critical misinterpretation** of the phrase “increased the value by 150%.”\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Correct Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "> A 150% increase in value means the house is now worth 2.5 times its original value:\n",
    "> - Final value = \\$80,000 × 2.5 = \\$200,000  \n",
    "> - Total cost = \\$80,000 + \\$50,000 = \\$130,000  \n",
    "> - Correct profit = \\$200,000 - \\$130,000 = **\\$70,000**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model's Blind Spot\n",
    "\n",
    "The model repeatedly confirmed that its reasoning was correct, even after receiving multiple feedback prompts. This reveals a **key limitation** of self-refinement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model may **fail to revise deeply-rooted misunderstandings** introduced in the initial draft.\n",
    "- Self-refinement can help fix superficial issues or unclear steps, but may **reinforce incorrect logic** if no contradiction is explicitly detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "This example highlights that **semantic comprehension failures**—especially in interpreting problem constraints—can persist despite multiple refinement rounds. Thus, additional techniques (e.g., external symbolic checkers or logic verifiers) may be needed to further enhance factual correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1.3 Subtle Misinterpretation Despite Confident Reasoning in Round 2 and 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Some failures in the self-refine pipeline occur not due to incoherent logic, but because of **subtle misinterpretation of the problem's phrasing**. A representative example is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consistently followed these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Total pages to read:  \n",
    "   $$ 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 $$  \n",
    "2. Pages left after Monday:  \n",
    "   $$ 49 - 15 = 34 $$  \n",
    "3. Average per day:  \n",
    "   $$ 34 \\div 4 = 8.5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the predicted answer: **8.5 pages per day**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gold Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the ground truth answer is **6**, which suggests a different interpretation:  \n",
    "> The phrase *\"If he has 4 more days to complete all his reading...\"* may imply that the **total reading should be completed over 5 days** (including Monday), and the 15 pages read on Monday should be evenly distributed over all 5 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ambiguity in wording makes the question prone to **interpretation bias**, and although the model’s logic is consistent, its **assumption diverged from the annotator's intended meaning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Self-Refine Didn’t Help\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model made the same assumption in each round.\n",
    "- Feedback was affirmative (\"no improvement needed\"), which **reinforced the original mistake**.\n",
    "- The model **lacked external grounding or counterexamples** to reassess the initial assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when the solution is clearly and rigorously explained, **an incorrect but confident interpretation** of the problem can persist across refinement rounds. This exposes a limitation in current self-refinement techniques:  \n",
    "> They improve clarity and consistency, but not always **semantic alignment with task intent**."

    "### 7.2 Example Invalid Failure Case\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2.1 Invalid Model Output and Session Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "In analyzing the predictions marked as `\"INVALID\"`, we observed that **a large portion of them stem from corrupted model outputs or malformed message histories**. One representative example is **index 891**, which demonstrates this failure pattern clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What Went Wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Corrupted Initial Draft Output**  \n",
    "   The very first assistant reply in this case was clearly malformed:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   To determine the speed of a^Cluea^Cluea^Cluea^Cluea^Clue...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This suggests the model encountered an internal decoding error or entered a repetition loop, producing garbage tokens instead of a coherent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Empty or Invalid Message History**  \n",
    "   Because the assistant's draft was unusable, the subsequent message list failed to include a valid assistant reply. When the refinement loop attempted to continue, the model API raised repeated errors:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The messages list should not contain only one message with role \"system\".\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This indicates that the session context was broken—without at least one valid user-assistant exchange, the model cannot proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Tokens Used, No Progress Made**  \n",
    "   All subsequent attempts to call the model failed with status 400, resulting in a final token usage of zero. Thus, the loop never performed meaningful refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why This Case Was Marked as \"INVALID\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior matches our criteria for abnormal or unusable outputs:\n",
    "- The predicted answer string was empty or corrupted\n",
    "- The session never progressed beyond the first broken response\n",
    "- Total token usage was 0 (indicating the model never worked on a proper input)\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore mark such cases explicitly as `\"INVALID\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### General Trend\n",
    "\n",
    "This failure mode appears frequently among `INVALID` predictions. Most of them share one or more of the following traits:\n",
    "- Garbled or repeated output in the initial draft\n",
    "- Missing assistant messages causing an invalid session\n",
    "- Repeated API failures caused by broken context"

    "## 8. Final Summary and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "This report analyzed the performance of a **Self-Refine pipeline** applied to the GSM8K dataset, using a math-instruct tuned language model (`qwen2.5-math-1.5b-instruct`). The system was designed to iteratively refine its own reasoning, ideally improving answer accuracy through critique and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total samples evaluated**: 1318  \n",
    "- **Valid completions**: 1308 (99.24%)  \n",
    "- **Invalid completions**: 10 (0.76%) – mostly caused by decoding failures or malformed outputs (e.g., repeated tokens, API truncation, or malformed responses like `^Clue^Clue...`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the valid samples:\n",
    "- **Correct answers**: 1074 (≈82.1%)  \n",
    "- **Incorrect but well-formed**: 234 (≈17.9%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refinement Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Most common exit**:  \n",
    "  - **Round 2 early stop** (59.3% of all cases) — indicating the model often \"believed\" its own answer was already optimal early on.\n",
    "- **Full 5-round execution**:  \n",
    "  - Happened in **38.8% of samples**, suggesting many tasks benefited from extended refinement.\n",
    "- **Very few samples** stopped at round 3 or 4, suggesting these are edge cases or transitional rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Token Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average token usage per session**: ~8,687 tokens  \n",
    "- **Maximum observed usage**: 28,253 tokens  \n",
    "- **Minimum**: 0 tokens (tied to early aborts or invalid output)\n",
    "\n",
    "The token count confirms that **long conversations were common**, particularly for problems that required full five-round processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Error Categories Observed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decoding Failures**: e.g., garbled responses like `^Clue^Clue...`, which led to invalid outputs and early system-level termination.\n",
    "- **Misinterpretation of Problem Intent**: Even when logic and math were sound, misreading ambiguous phrasing led to confidently wrong predictions.\n",
    "  - Example: interpreting \"read over 4 more days\" as dividing over 4, when the annotator expected average over 5 days.\n",
    "- **Over-Refinement Drift**: Some correct initial answers were overwritten in later rounds due to redundant or misaligned feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strength**: The Self-Refine setup enhances answer robustness in many cases, pushing the model to reason step-by-step and catch simple errors.\n",
    "- **Limitation**: The system may confidently repeat flawed assumptions if no external ground truth or re-framing is introduced.\n",
    "- **Cost**: Full refinement consumes significant tokens, especially in 5-round cases.\n"
