      "To determine the probability \\( p \\) that an object starting at \\((0,0)\\) reaches \\((2,2)\\) in six or fewer steps, we need to analyze the possible paths and their probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, note that to reach \\((2,2)\\) from \\((0,0)\\), the object must take exactly 2 steps right (R) and 2 steps up (U). This means the remaining 2 steps can be either left (L) or down (D), but they must cancel out the extra steps taken right or up. Therefore, the total number of steps must be exactly 4 (2 R and 2 U) because any additional steps would not help in reaching \\((2,2)\\) in fewer than 6 steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of ways to arrange 2 R's, 2 U's, and 2 steps that cancel each other out (which can be either 2 L's and 2 D's, or 1 L, 1 D, and 2 steps that are not R or U) is the number of ways to arrange 4 R's and 2 U's in 6 steps, which is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{2,2,2} = \\frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we need to ensure that the object does not move outside the bounds of the first quadrant (i.e., it does not move left or down more than necessary). The only valid paths are those that consist of exactly 2 R's, 2 U's, and 2 steps that are either L's or D's, but in such a way that the object does not move outside the first quadrant. The only valid path is the one where the extra steps are exactly 2 L's and 2 D's, which is not possible because it would take more than 6 steps to return to the first quadrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the only valid path is the one where the object takes exactly 2 R's and 2 U's in the first 4 steps, and then the remaining 2 steps are either L's or D's that cancel each other out. The number of valid paths is the number of ways to arrange 2 R's and 2 U's in 4 steps, which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "The total number of possible paths of length 6 is \\(4^6 = 4096\\), because each step has 4 possible directions.\n",
